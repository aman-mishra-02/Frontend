    <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of
        superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic
        books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series,
        and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by
        crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</p>

    <p>The first MCU film is Iron Man (2008), which began the films of Phase One culminating in the crossover film The
        Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began
        with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three
        phases in the franchise are collectively known as "The Infinity Saga". The films of Phase Four began with Black
        Widow (2021)</p>

    <p>Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013, before
        further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu, and cable television on Freeform. They also
        produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own
        television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four.
        The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called
        Marvel One-Shots, and a viral marketing campaign for the films featuring the faux news program WHIH Newsfront.
    </p>

    <p>The franchise has been commercially successful and has generally received positive reviews. It has inspired other
        film and television studios to attempt to create similar shared universes with comic book character adaptations.
        The MCU has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for
        each film, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Films</h3>

    <p>By 2005, Marvel Entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them
        through Paramount Pictures.[2] Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia
        Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox.[3] Marvel
        made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of
        its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution.[4] Avi Arad, head of Marvel's
        film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony Pictures, but was less pleased with others.
        As a result, Arad decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since
        DreamWorks.[5]</p>

    <h3>Television</h3>

    <h4>Marvel Television</h4>

    <p>In June 2010, Marvel Television was launched with Jeph Loeb as head.[25] By July 2012, Marvel Television had
        entered into discussions with ABC to create a show set in the MCU;[26] the network ultimately created the series
        Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter,[27] and Inhumans, which was a co-production with IMAX
        Corporation.[28][29][30] In November 2013, Disney was set to provide Netflix with the live-action series
        Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, leading up to the miniseries The Defenders.[31] In April
        2016, Netflix ordered The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil.[32] By February 2019, Netflix had cancelled all
        of their Marvel series.[33] In January 2021, Feige said "never say never" to potentially reviving the series,
        but noted Marvel Studios was focused on their new Disney+ series announced at that time.[34] In April 2016, the
        Disney-owned cable network Freeform announced Cloak & Dagger.[35] In May 2017, Marvel announced that Runaways
        had received a series order from Hulu.[36] In May 2019, Marvel announced that Helstrom had been greenlit for
        Hulu.[37]</p>

    <h4>Marvel Studios</h4>

    <p>By November 2017, Disney was looking to develop a new Marvel television series for their streaming service
        Disney+.[40] In July 2018, Feige noted discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement
        Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service, since Feige felt the service was "an important thing for
        the company".[41] In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series
        centered on "second-tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own
        films. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than
        Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.[42] Feige noted the series
        being developed for the streaming service would "tell stories... that we wouldn't be able to tell in a
        theatrical experience – a longer-form narrative".[43] He also added that being asked by Disney to create these
        series "energized everyone creatively" within Marvel Studios, since they "could play in a new medium and throw
        the rules out the window in terms of structure and format".[44]</p>
